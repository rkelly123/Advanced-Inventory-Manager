# Advanced-Inventory-Manager
 
An attempt at a more advanced inventory manager. The goal is to familiarize myself with new technologies for each section of the application.

To begin, I am using React and Redux to create the frontend.

Can find the project hosted on: https://front-inventory-manager.onrender.com/

Please note: the first time that the website is accessed after some time, it will take a couple of minutes for the backend to spin up, resulting in longer waiting times.
